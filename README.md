# Palindrome Checker

This Python program simulates a Turing Machine to check whether a binary string (composed of `0`s and `1`s) is a palindrome. It utilizes three tapes (`input`, `work`, and `output`) and a finite set of states to perform the computation.

## Features

- **Simulated Turing Machine**: Implements tape-based computation with head movement and state transitions.
- **Palindrome Detection**: Determines if an input binary string reads the same forwards and backwards.
- **Debugging Mode**: Prints detailed step-by-step operations of the Turing Machine.

## Tapes and States

1. **Input Tape**: Contains the binary string to be checked.
2. **Work Tape**: Used for intermediate computation and reverse copying of the input string.
3. **Output Tape**: Outputs `1` if the input is a palindrome, `0` otherwise.

### States
- **`begin`**: Initializes the computation and sets up the tapes.
- **`copy`**: Copies the input string to the work tape in reverse order.
- **`check`**: Compares the input tape with the work tape to verify the palindrome.
- **`halt`**: Final state indicating completion of the computation.

## How It Works

1. **Initialization**: The input string is written to the input tape with delimiters (`▷` and `☐`).
2. **Copy Phase**: The input string is copied in reverse order to the work tape.
3. **Check Phase**: The input tape and the work tape are compared character by character.
4. **Result**: Writes `1` to the output tape if the input is a palindrome; otherwise, writes `0`.

## Usage
- Make sure Palindrome.py, Generate_data.py, and Main.py are in the same folder.
- (Optional) Have Batch_test.py in the same folder as well for testing.
- run Main.py
